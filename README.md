The name's Jerod. The game's not being a lost 60 year old typing with one finger and having my grandkids show me up.

According to my degree, which will be an achievment unlocked in December 2022, I'm techinically an "IT expert," but after an internship I have my doubts. Therefore, I am attempting to expand into the embers of software development.

I have no previous, "big picture" experiences for my current coding skills, however after two years of high school computer science, two college-level courses, and a few start n' stop courses on Udemy and LinkedIn Learning, I think it's fair to say I can doggy paddle in the shallowest of creeks.

Why coding? I get to 1) feel my fingers against these plastic keys and 2) problem solve in a way that's constantly evolving/morphing to new skills, concepts, and solutions.

Current languages include (most to least experienced): VBA, Java, HTML, JavaScript, Python, and mySQL.

Like music, my coding skills are always looking to be improved. I've written a few scripts to create/edit .csv files; created many Excel documents mapping out expenses, staff processes, hours worked, etc.; and delved slightly into web-scraping.

ALL IN DUE TIME
